I still remember one night at the Hollywood bowl how I reacted when I overheard some people express concern that there had been a threat of a shooting.

It was one of preparation and actual, though modest, fear.

I have truly enjoy shooting guns from time to time.

I have never enjoyed it so much that it in any way justifies the profoundly lackadaisical regulation of weapons in this country that ensures that people having a bad day do what is obvious to them and either shoot themselves or imagined enemies.

It may "only" be ~30,000 people killed every year in the US, but probably 10X that experience some kind of direct impact from the terror caused by those shootings.

What are we doing here? Why choose to live this way?

If it's so fun to shoot and hunt, then isn't it worth a slightly higher cost of regulation to prevent the worst side effects?

It sucks that we have so little reason for optimism that our laws could be adjusted to begin addressing this.

As a solutions-oriented engineer-type, I find it simply baffling and existentially annoying.

As much as I get annoyed by the Democratic Party, the GOP is so far from being rooted in a willingness to govern based on obvious, rational principles, it's simply inconceivable to me that I will ever vote in a way that gives them the chance to do so.

Over the last 10 years, the trajectory of the GOP has been one of consistently choosing policies that cause slightly higher levels of misery for most people in exchange for solving either an imaginary goal (voter fraud) or a problem that only the 0.1% percentile of Americans have (which is really a nother form of imaginary problems, since it is sold as though we all suffer from problems like the inheritance tax).

It is so freaking toxic and infuriating.

Honestly, if the only fantasy that was gripping the GOP was QAnon, we wouldn't have that much to worry about. It's merely the silliest.
