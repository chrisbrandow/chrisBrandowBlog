I have a lot of sympathy for the *sentiment* behind many complaints about cancel culture. It's a disorienting time as the cultural mores are moving closer to the more progressive views and experiences of the younger, and historically marginalized segments of our population. For real.

But that doesn't mean we have to pretend to be stupid.

Did I have a twinge of "oh come on!" when I heard that Dr. Suess books were getting pulled? Yeah, though I was already aware that his earliest work was complicated, at best.

But did I immediately understand once I saw one of the illustrations? Indeed.

The tell that everyone else complaining publicly about this is indeed bluffing is that not a single one of them is trotting out the illustrations and saying that there are NO problems with it.

I used to *love* the Dr. Doolitle books that I read as a kid, and that my dad read as a kid. But I didn't read them to my kids. It makes me sad, because the essence of those books (as I remember them, anyway) were a magical mix of adventure, fantasy, and nature. But at least a couple of them depict Africans in unacceptable ways. For me the razor as to whether I could read them to my kids was to picture myself reading a problematic section as a Black friend of mine walked in. No way. It was an easy decision after that mental exercise. 

So, I'm not even interested in the "Dr. Seuss Discourse". It's a bluff.
