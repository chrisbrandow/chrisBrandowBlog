Is there any explanation that is better (in an Occam's razor sense) for why Donald Trump was able to be elected than the consequences of the following two trends:

* The substantial rise of income inequality which has eliminated much of the segment of the middle class that provided a relatively pleasant lifestyle.
* The (not entirely unrelated) deep decline of unions in the Midwest.

The result is that you have a lot of angry, and unaffiliated voters with no particular attachment to any party, thus ripe for a demagogue.


I guess this is a super clich√© observation, but no other explanation seems as compelling.
