I'm a big fan of Matthew Yglesias, having read his blog since he was an undergrad. Recently he talked about the value of making specific predictions along with some form of certainty. I had just started to do that in the Fall after the election, trying to figure out what was going to happen with Trump and all. I never finished it, but it was helpful to clarify my thinking.

I'd like to put down a few thoughts about what I think is happening with Trump over the next couple of years.

It is difficult to predict "what will happen", because there are a lot of dependencies, so I am going to try to enumerate the key dynamics and how likely I think that they are.

1. Trump will promote other candidates.
2. Trump will hold rallies
3. Trump will have an active media presence
4. Trump will start a media/social media venture
5. Trump will align himself with a media/social media presence
6. Trump will be indicted
7. Trump will be dragged down by legal issues.
8. Trump will be dragged down by financial issues.
9. Trump will meaningfully decline healthwise.

The primary outcomes that will result from the factors above
1. Trump will run for president in 2024
2. A Trump family member will run for anything in 2024
