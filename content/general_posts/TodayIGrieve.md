Today I Am Grieving

My conception about what America is and, more to the point, even is capable of being is changing day by day.

I grew up as patriotic as possible. Literal 4th of July parades, complete with my bike draped in red, white and blue crepe paper. I could make a long list, but let's just cut to the chase. To me America has always been that imperfect nation striving towards commonly held ideals about the equality of people in the context of stable, citizen-directed government. My essential understanding is that we basically lived by the following agreement. There are rules that apply to everyone in our daily lives. They should be as fair as we could make them and that we should generally follow them except in extreme circumstances. The government, on behalf of all the people, should generally make sure the rules were followed and take care of the stuff that requires real expertise or that lies beyond the scope of a few people doing some stuff.

The last 4 years have been a violation of a lot of the "what government's job" part of the agreement, given Trump's complete incompetence and disinterest in doing anything for anyone but himself, but at a very deep level I still felt like that was going to be OK, because fundamentally I thought that pretty much everyone agreed with everything else I outlined.

But the last couple months have really undermined a lot of what I thought was "true" about the American people. It turns out that our commitment to our form of government is fairly weak, and that just 4 years of steady rhetorical assault can make lots and lots of people pretty comfortable with whatever exercise of power aligns with their perceived preferences.

I think that most people who go along with whatever violations of governing norms that Trump commits on a given day, are not thinking about giving up on democracy in the US, they are thinking about keeping themselves, their family and their community safe from the libs that want to ruin everything that they hold dear, so doing this "extreme" thing is completely worth it for now, "until the threat is under control".

Boy howdy, this is a fascinating time. And I'll hopefully come back to it, but based on just a small amount of reading about the early 19th century, the steady growth of polarization in the last 20 years seem so analogous to the slavery debate. I still am amazed that after our system of government was unable to resolve that political crisis without civil war, there were no changes made to the structure of government.

But today is not the day for that kind of analysis. Today I am grieving. In reality I am not grieving the loss of what actually existed. The list is long of ways in which my idea of America was so wrong. 

No, I am grieving my idea of what existed. I am also grappling with the fear of how "things" could go badly if we collectively give up on the idea of what America is or should strive to beâ€¦
