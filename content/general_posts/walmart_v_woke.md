As a fully esconced member of the Left Coast Elite, I am mostly exactly what you'd expect in terms of politics, etc. As such, I basically only go to Target for my general, non-grocery shopping, rather than Walmart. This has primarily been an issue of proximity. The nearest Walmart is 20 minutes away, rather than 7 for Target. But, let's be real, I also prefer Target.

However, the kids and I were on a road trip, and we had to stop at the Walmart on the way out of town, trying to grab some quick hiking boots/shoes for the boy and Target was out. I noticed a couple things that I hadn't noticed before. In the shoe and clothing section, there were items completly targeted to various service/blue collar industries. These items are essentially absent from any Target that I've been to. The items included a complete rack of black shoes, (for restaurant work) and a variety of reflective vests and outerwear (for construction or highway work).

I mulled over that for a while and how striking the difference was. All the obvious class things occurred to me, and that was sort of the end of it. But after the 2020 election and the seeming[^1] improvement of Trump support among Latino and Black men, I recalled that visit and had the thought, "Who is a Latino construction worker more likely to relate to? Me, a computer programming, white lib who owns his home, or a "politically-incorrect", MAGA-loving white guy who gets along just fine with his co-workers, works hard and faces the same money challenges that he does? It doesn't seem that complicated, does it?

Well, that's why this [blog post][blogLink] makes a ton of sense to me. Read it for a more detailed examination of the dynamic I just described:

[^1]: I'm not pretending this is some sort of established fact. It seems likely to be partially true and worth paying attention to.
