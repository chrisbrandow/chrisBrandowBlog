# Intro

I have thoughts. And I like expressing my thoughts. I doubt anyone else actually cares. I aspire to blog about them. But I rarely do. Why?

Two (or Three) reasons:

First, I let the tools get in the way. I think I can get over that.

Second, I take too long to get the idea expressed as clearly as I'd like, so then I stop, so I can get to more pressing work, then never or rarely finish the draft.

(Third, ) It is the vicious cycle between the two. I pick a tooling setup, and spend time on it, then write a post or so, and then get bogged down, and then so much time passes that I am back to reconsidering if tooling is the problem.

Here's my new effort: I will sketch out the thesis of my idea, add as much detail and color as I can/want, and publish. I am going to try to do this every time I have an idea I feel like posting.

I'm inspired here by MG Siegler's 500ish Medium posts. He has set aside tooling/hosting concerns. He's doing quick hits in an unpolished (for him) fashion. I am basically trying the same thing, but without holding myself to quality standards that are not realistic for me.
