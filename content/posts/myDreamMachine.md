I was just thinking about the "best" laptops recently due to the 20 macs for 2020, which reminded me of Marco's declaration that the 2015 MacBook Pro was the pinnacle of that product line. I have always agreed with that sentiment.

Anyway, it made fantasize about taking a 2015 Macbook Pro, slicing off a few mm of height and fitting it with an M1X or M2, or whatever new chip Apple will release for that line. You'd have an incredibly versatile laptop with a battery that lasts for 10 hours, and the only penalty that you'd pay is maybe a pound of extra weight.*

What a dream machine that would be.

* yes, there should be other models that aren't that versatile and are lighter, etc.
