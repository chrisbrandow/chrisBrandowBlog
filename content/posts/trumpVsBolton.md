Maybe I'm being too optimistic, but it certainly seems to me that one of John Bolton's defining features is knowing how to work the system to acheive his ends. Given that Trump's opposition to him spilling the beans in his book was a compelete certainty, I am fairly confident that Bolton has both anticipated this reaction, and has devised a pretty clear strategy for handling it. This book will be released.
