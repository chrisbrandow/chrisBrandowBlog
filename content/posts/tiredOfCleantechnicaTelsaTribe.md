Obviously, this does not apply to every single article on the topic, but it certainly is characteristic of the overall tone. The article that I am citing here is by Johanna Crider, and this is the first article that I've noticed with her byline, so I feel bad to make my first post on this topic. While I appreciate so much the work of writers like Zach Shahan, among others, his work has definitely had this tone on many occasions.

### An Example Of How This Perspective Leads Their Writers Astray

This quote is really what convinced me to write a post. It is a great example of where advocacy *for* Tesla appears to shift into implicitly rooting for others failure:

> The narrative more generally is that Tesla is on top now, but it won’t be for long. However, such claims have not turned out well so far.

The reason that I particularly dislike this quote is that it seems incompatible with a goal that eventually all or most cars will be electric. In such a world, Tesla will obviously not be the dominant electric car maker because there won't be a dominant electric car maker. There will just be a lot of car makers and all the cars are electric.

Of course, this is not necessarily the author's intention. She does write the following earlier:

> Why must any new electric vehicle be a Tesla killer? The idea that we have a “killer” is not only negative but divisive and is rooted in jealousy.

I think that my first read did overlook some of the nuance that clearly exists in the article, but that is at least in part by how many articles on this site have been framed this way. I think that she is merely defending against the notion that Tesla's sales cannot be sustained and that other companies' success would relegate Tesla to the trashbin.

In the article, the author also says this:

>We’re not picking on the Bolt here.

This might be better phrased as *"we aren't intending to pick on the Bolt here."* Between the title, the opening paragraphs and the charts, it is undeniable that the article does pick on the bolt. By pitting Tesla's sales against GM sales seems to put the success of these two companies's electric vehicle sales in opposition to one another. They aren't. We need great, good, mediocre and barely adequate electric vehicles of all kinds from all kinds of companies, so that there are more electric vehicle sales that displace gasoline vehicles.

I hope that Cleantechnica, can tweak their editorial process to avoid this tone. I am *tired* of it. But maybe it's just me and I'm seeing something that isn't there.
