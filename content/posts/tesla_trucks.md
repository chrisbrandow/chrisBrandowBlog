I write this as an enormous admirer of what Elon Musk is accomplishing with Tesla, though I'm not actaully a Tesla owner.

I find the Tesla truck announcement "controversy" exhausting. This is mostly Tesla's fault, but not because they have made a bad design, but because they aren't being entirely forthright about what this product is supposed to be, which is fine, most car makers do this with many of their products. However, in most cases, they are following certain industry "standards" of mis-representing a product's purpose. Most obviously, and in this case applies to Tesla as well, SUV's are not really designed to be used in most cases for sports or utility. Obviously, all of them can handle the technical needs of offroading, carrying large quantities of supplies, etc. But very few of the design and product decisions make the tradeoffs that prioritize those use cases. Most, by a long shot, purchasers of SUV's are urban or suburban folks, especially those with kids. Tesla pushed the limit on this misrepresentation by touting the 0-60 times for its Model X SUV. Acceleration performance really couldn't have less to do with the nominal purpose of an SUV.

So, I think it's plain that this truck is designed in much the same way, just as many "two rows of seats" trucks are as well. Many, if not most, trucks are still used literally for utility, but a large and growing number are not. Tesla is likewise pushing this disconnect even more than it did with the Model X, and it did so with the design. This is a truck that can definitely do "truck things", but it is absolutely designed to be used as a car. That's great! But because they signaled this with design, it is freaking everyone out, and we are having weird, unwinnable arguments of whether this is a "good" truck.

This kind of thing just makes me tired.
