I am really trying to read more. This is at least in part because I want to spend less time on my phone. I figure that this would be easier if I have something else to replace it with that is less mentally consuming and distracting.

Please understand that I'm not "proud" of all the books on this list. However, I am currently considering an hour spent reading a stupid book rather than an hour browsing the internet to be a win. Primarily because it seems to me that my mind is in a more aware state when I am reading than when I am browsing.

### These are books I've read in 2018

The Fifth Risk - Michael Lewis  
Void Moon - Michael Connely  
Creative Selection - Ken Kocienda
